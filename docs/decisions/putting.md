## Putting (manual pace-meter by default; auto ONLY via the Penelope Putter caddy)
- **Two putt models, one shared `PuttSkill`.** AUTO putting is the rng `onePutt` (make%/lag);
  `puttOut`/`puttOutFrom` step it; it's what the headless sim and `takeShot(…, autoPutt)` use.
  MANUAL putting is `manualPutt` — SKILL, not luck: the player controls PACE via an on-screen meter
  (`render/puttMeter.ts`, a Canvas2D side-effect like the play view), auto-aimed at the cup. Stop the
  sweeping marker inside the green MAKE band to drop it; too soft leaves it short, too firm runs past;
  a small distance-scaled lateral wobble (one rng draw) means long putts can lip out on good pace while
  short ones drop reliably. Constants `MANUAL_IDEAL_PACE`/`MANUAL_PACE_MAX`/`DEFAULT_MANUAL_BAND` are
  shared by the resolver and the meter so they agree. `takePutt(state, loadout, rng, control?)`:
  `control` (the pace) → `manualPutt`; no control → `onePutt` (the AI-finish path + tests),
  so auto stays byte-for-byte. The reducer `putt` action carries `control?: PuttControl`.
  GOTCHA (fixed): the meter's `commit()` MUST read `currentPace()` BEFORE setting `committed = true`
  — `currentPace` short-circuits to the (still-0) `frozenPace` once committed, so the old order struck
  every manual putt at pace 0 (ball never moved, stroke still counted).
- **Auto-putt is caddy-only — there is NO manual toggle.** Putting is manual UNLESS you hire the
  legendary **Penelope Putter** caddy (shop id still `auto-caddie` for save-compat; sets
  `loadout.autoPutt`), which auto-putts out on arrival. The old
  per-session `UiState.autoPutt` toggle + `toggleAutoPutt` action were removed: the `shot` reducer's
  auto gate is just `!!run.loadout.autoPutt`, so owning the caddie is the one and only "automate it"
  switch. (`» Auto-finish hole` on the decision screen still AI-plays the whole hole — that's a
  full-hole watch escape, not a putting mode.)
- **Putt from the fringe/apron (GS-fringe-putt).** Being just off the green on the apron (a `fairway`
  lie wrapping the green) used to force a full-swing chip from a few yards — a huge spray cone + a
  fiddly feathered pull (the "weird shot pull" complaint). Now `canPuttFringe(state)` (play.ts: a
  non-penalty `fairway`/`rough` lie within `FRINGE_PUTT_RANGE` 14yd of the pin) lets you take the
  flat-stick with the pace meter, and it's the DEFAULT there (`selPutt` UI flag, a one-tap ⛳/🏌 toggle
  to chip instead). `takePutt`'s guard is relaxed to accept a fringe lie (it still sets the rest lie to
  `green`). CRITICAL: interactive-ONLY — the auto sim only ever putts on `green` (and the auto-finish
  path gates on `awaitingPutt`, green-only), so auto≡interactive is byte-for-byte untouched; no new
  `_gs*` flag (`selPutt` is module UI state like `selClubId`). Tests: `tests/fringe-putt`.
- **Putting is upgradeable (`loadout.puttBoost`, 0 = base).** `puttSkillOf` derives make%/lag AND the
  manual make-band width from `puttBoost` + auto-caddie; a BASE loadout returns `{}` so auto/headless
  stay byte-for-byte. Shop perks **Pro Putting Grip** (stackable) + **Tour Putter** raise `puttBoost`;
  the meta upgrade **Putting Coach** bakes it into the starting loadout. `puttBoost` is rebuilt from
  perks/meta on resume, so NO save bump. `tests/manual-putt.test.ts` guards the pace model + that the
  upgrades widen the band and sink more putts; `tests/putting.test.ts` still guards the auto model.

## Putting DEPTH — distance matters, putters matter, hard greens break (GS-putt-depth)
The complaint: "there's no reason to take any putting upgrades or putters" and "the make window never
does anything." Both were true because the make band was a CONSTANT pace fraction regardless of putt
length — on a flat green a base putter already holed everything, so a wider band bought nothing you
could feel, and long putts were no harder than short ones. GS-putt-depth makes putting a genuine skill/
gear axis on three fronts, all interactive-only (the headless `onePutt` auto path is byte-for-byte
untouched — it never reads slope or range).

- **The make band SHRINKS with distance.** `puttBandDistanceFactor(d, range)` (round.ts) is `1` within
  the putter's confident `range`, then a smooth reciprocal taper to a floor (`PUTT_BAND_FLOOR`) beyond
  it. `manualPutt` scales its pace make-band by this factor; the on-screen meter (`app.ts` → `mountPuttMeter`)
  draws the SAME shrunk band, so the green window you aim at is exactly the one that drops the putt (contract
  5). A tap-in / short putt is factor 1 → **byte-for-byte the old flat band**, which is *why* every existing
  fixed-ideal-pace test (`manual-putt`, `putt-break`) still passes: those strike at `MANUAL_IDEAL_PACE` so
  `paceErr = 0 ≤` any positive band, shrunk or not. Only OFF-ideal paces feel the tighter window — i.e. real
  play. **Only the PACE window is distance-scaled;** the lateral `wobble` stays keyed to the putter's
  INHERENT `manualBand` (not the shrunk one), so lateral skill is a property of the flat-stick and the whole
  distance penalty lives in one place.
- **The putter's `puttRange` is the upgrade.** `puttSkillOf` returns `puttRange = DEFAULT_PUTT_RANGE +
  min(0.7, b)·12`, so every putter perk / Putting Coach / auto-caddie that raises `puttBoost` also reads +
  holes from further. A base loadout still returns `{}` (no `puttRange`) → the resolver falls back to
  `DEFAULT_PUTT_RANGE`, so nothing changes for a fresh bag beyond the universal distance taper. This is the
  concrete "reason to buy a putter": at 18 yd a legendary flat-stick keeps a wide band a base putter has
  long since lost.
- **The break READ has a length.** The dotted break curve is drawn bright/solid-dashed only out to the
  putter's confident range and fades to a faint wide-dashed "you're guessing" tail beyond, with a tick where
  the confidence ends (`RenderOptions.puttReadFrac`, holeView.ts; `frac = range/puttLen`). A green-reading
  **Mystic Mole** (`greenRead`) sees the WHOLE break → `frac = 1`, a clear visible caddy benefit. The HUD
  spells it out ("past Ny the read goes blind — a better putter reads further").
- **Harder stops tilt the greens more.** The green-slope magnitude multiplier floor rises with wildness:
  `slopeMag = greenSlopeMax · range(0.4 + 0.45·wildness, 1)`. A CALM stop (wildness ≈ 0) keeps the old
  `range(0.4, 1)` draw **byte-for-byte**; a wild stop biases steeper — a stiffer, breakier putt — but never
  past the biome's `greenSlopeMax` ceiling (so `green-slope.test` still holds) and drawn from the SIDE slope
  rng (terrain stream intact, every LAYOUT byte-identical). Steeper greens read with a FINER, denser fall-line
  arrow grid (`styleGreen`: `cols`/`rows`/`len` scale with `slope.mag`) — camera-proof, a fixed count off the
  deterministic magnitude. The auto sim only feels this through `walkRoll`'s green roll-out; the death-spiral
  and character-balance bars were re-run and hold (the manual-putt break itself never touches the auto path).
- **No new hook.** All tuning is round.ts module constants (the sim stays node-pure — no `window` read), so
  there is no `_gs*` flag / `?param` and the test-hub sync guard is unaffected. `tests/putt-depth.test.ts`
  guards the factor curve, the range-upgrade → more-long-makes claim, the within-range byte-equality, and the
  wildness → steeper-greens statistic.

### Feel fixes after first play-test (GS-putt-depth)
The first build shipped the mechanics but three things read wrong in the hand — all render/UX, zero sim
change (every seeded test byte-identical):
- **The fall-line arrows overpowered the green.** They were sized as a FRACTION of the green's course-space
  span (`len = span·0.3`), so on a big green they became bold lines stretching clear across the putt-zoom
  view. Now they're SMALL glyphs capped in ABSOLUTE course-yards (`len = min(span·0.16, 3.4)`, gaps capped
  likewise), thinner (`sw 1.1`) and fainter (opacity `0.3 + steep·0.12`, was up to 0.64) — a compact
  fall-line marker that reads at any zoom, denser only by a row/col on the steepest greens.
- **Long, big-breaking putts weren't reachable.** The aim nudge was clamped to ±12 yd with a flat 0.4-yd
  step — a long sidehiller needed more break than that to cancel, and dialing it was ~30 taps. The clamp +
  step now scale with the putt (`puttAimMax = max(8, |ideal|·1.6 + 4)`, `step = max(0.4, max/14)`), and
  consecutive quick taps ACCELERATE (up to ~5×, `performance.now` in the side-effect layer) so a burst
  covers the range fast while single taps stay precise.
- **Short putts framed weird.** The putt camera had a flat 9-yд `viewRadius` floor, so a tap-in sat tiny in
  a big view. Lowered to `max(5.5, dist·0.6 + 3)` so a short putt actually zooms in (with a little green
  around the cup for context) while long putts are unchanged.
